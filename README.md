Welcome to the 2nd Entelect Game Jam! We hope you'll have a lot of fun making a fun little game today.

# Theme & Rules

The theme is simple: make a fun platformer in using the provided art and this example project as starting point (both optional, but recommended due to the short timeframe).

In terms of rules:
 * You have 8 hours (+1 for submission). Start at 08:00 finish at 17:00.
 * During submission hour submit Windows binaries to: https://itch.io/jam/entelect-jam-2
 * __May__ use at the supplied art: [Kenney Platformer Stuff](http://kenney.nl/assets?s=platformer)
 * __May__ use any free / open-source art or sound resources.
 * Individual submissions (no teams).

After submission we'll play each other's games and vote on 3 categories:
 * Fun: Is the game fun?
 * Graphics: Is the game pretty and juicy?
 * Coolness: Does the game perhaps fall flat in other areas but tried to do something cool?

The prizes are bobble heads / figurines:
 * Overall winner: Splinter
 * Coolness: Michelangelo
 * Fun: Donatello
